The Hidden Gems application will display a map and ranking of the businesses located in the user’s city, as well as offer the option to get tailored recommendations based on the user's preferences.

The hidden gems’ information will be collected from Google Maps, including:
- Business’ name
- Location
- Star rating
- Restaurant type
- Type of cuisine
- Price range 
It is expected that the map of the hidden gems displays the greater city, with potentially the option to zoom within a 10km radius of their location. 

The ranking will display the top 10 hidden gems ordered by distance then star rating. It is hoped that the user will have the option to modify the ranking based on their current location (i.e.: businesses within a 10km radius) but also by type of cuisine or overall sentiment of the business’ reviews. 

The tailored recommendations will be collected through a form asking about their preferences regarding price range, type of cuisine, restaurant type, takeaway/dinner and minimum rating. The application is, then, expected to display a list of the top 3 businesses satisfying the user’s preferences. An optional feature which is hoped to be added is to consider the sentiment analysis score of the businesses’ reviews when making selecting the top businesses.
